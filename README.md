## This is an early proof of concept showcasing what macros could look like when they land in Dart. Beware: Due to many missing Macro features, several features are either incomplete or broken. Use at your own risk! :)


### **Identified Issues:**

- [ ] Implement macros for generating `toJson` method
- [ ] Implement macros for generating `fromJson` method
- [ ] Address enum handling in serialization
- [ ] Enhance collection handling during serialization
- [ ] Implement byte-to-JSON conversion
- [ ] Implement JSON-to-byte conversion
