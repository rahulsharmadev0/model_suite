### Key Takeaways:
1. Always prioritize **field-level declarations** over constructor-level declarations when handling `TypeAnnotationCode` or nullability to avoid logical errors during compilation.
2. Maintain a clear mapping between constructor parameters and class fields for consistent validation and accurate type handling.
3. Focus on aligning the macro logic with the actual class structure to ensure generated code is both valid and predictable.
